# Enhanced Post Analysis Features

This document provides an overview of the enhanced post analysis features powered by Exa.ai web scraping and AI analysis.

## Features Overview

1. **Post Analysis** - Basic AI-powered analysis of post content
2. **Learning Resources** - Web links to related educational content for further exploration
3. **Post Recommendations** - Premium feature for suggesting improvements to posts

## Setting Up Exa.ai Integration

To enable the web scraping functionality:

1. Sign up for an API key at [Exa.ai](https://exa.ai)
2. Add the following to your `.env` file:
   ```
   EXA_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   EXA_ENDPOINT=https://api.exa.ai
   ```

## API Endpoints

### 1. Basic Post Analysis

**Endpoint:** `/api/premium/posts/{postId}/analyze`

Provides a general analysis of the post content including main points, key topics, tone, and notable information.

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "analysis": "This post compares React, Vue, and Angular frameworks with their key strengths. Includes 2 code snippets and a performance chart image."
}
```

### 2. Post Summary and Learning Resources

**Endpoint:** `/api/premium/posts/{postId}/learning-resources`

Provides both a concise summary of the post content and a curated list of web resources related to the topics in the post, allowing users to first understand the core concepts and then deepen their understanding through additional resources.

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "post_id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
  "summary": "This post explores modern JavaScript frameworks with a focus on React, Vue.js, and Angular. It highlights how each framework uses component-based architecture but differs in their implementation approaches. The author compares their performance characteristics and describes ideal use cases for each, noting that React is particularly strong for large applications while Vue offers a gentler learning curve for beginners.",
  "topics": "React, Vue.js, Angular, JavaScript frameworks, component-based architecture",
  "resources": [
    {
      "title": "Understanding Modern JavaScript Frameworks",
      "url": "https://example.com/modern-js-frameworks",
      "text": "An in-depth guide to the most popular JavaScript frameworks...",
      "domain": "example.com",
      "published_date": "2023-04-15"
    },
    // Additional resources...
  ],
  "categorized_resources": {
    "Beginner Guides": [
      // Resources for beginners...
    ],
    "Advanced Resources": [
      // More technical resources...
    ],
    "Latest Developments": [
      // Recent updates in the field...
    ]
  }
}
```

### 3. Post Recommendations (Premium)

**Endpoint:** `/api/premium/posts/{postId}/recommendations`

Provides specific recommendations to improve the post's engagement and reach.

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "recommendations": {
    "title_suggestions": [
      "From Novice to Expert: Mastering Modern JavaScript Frameworks",
      "The Definitive Guide to React, Vue, and Angular in 2023",
      "Which JavaScript Framework Should You Choose? A Comparative Analysis"
    ],
    "structure_tips": [
      "Consider adding section headers to break up the content",
      "Include a comparison table for quick reference",
      "Add a brief conclusion summarizing key takeaways"
    ],
    "style_tips": [
      "Use more concrete examples to illustrate abstract concepts",
      "Consider adding code snippets to demonstrate implementation",
      "Add transition sentences between major sections"
    ],
    "content_suggestions": [
      "Include information about performance benchmarks",
      "Mention community size and support for each framework",
      "Address learning curve and documentation quality"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Implementation Details

### Technology Stack

1. **AI Analysis** - Powered by OpenAI through our existing CogniService
2. **Web Resources** - Scraped and curated using Exa.ai search API
3. **Categorization** - AI-powered categorization of resources for better navigation

### Workflow

1. Post content is analyzed to create a concise, informative summary
2. Key educational topics are extracted from the post
3. Topics are used to search for relevant resources using Exa.ai
4. Results are categorized and sorted by relevance
5. Additional metadata is included (publication dates, domain info)

### Frontend Integration Guidelines

When integrating these features into the frontend:

1. **Learning Resources Button** - Add a "Find Learning Resources" button on post view screens
2. **Resource Display** - Consider displaying resources in tabs or expandable sections by category
3. **Permission Handling** - Check user subscription status before showing premium features
4. **Caching** - Cache results where appropriate to minimize API calls

## Error Handling

The API will return meaningful error messages with appropriate HTTP status codes:

- `500` - Server errors or configuration issues 
- `404` - Post not found
- `403` - Premium feature access denied

## Rate Limits

To prevent abuse, the Exa.ai API has rate limits. Be mindful of these when implementing frontend features, and consider adding appropriate caching and throttling mechanisms.

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements to the system include:

1. Personalized resource recommendations based on user learning history
2. Bookmarking of specific resources to user's readlists
3. Resource rating and community curation
4. Direct content embedding from trusted sources
